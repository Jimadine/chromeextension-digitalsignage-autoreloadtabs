# chromeextension-digitalsignage-autoreloadtabs

A Chrome extension created for the University of York Library Digital Displays. The extension reloads all existing browsing tabs at a defined interval. The use-case for this extension is one in which a Google Drive hosted image is displayed on the Digital Displays, and provides a way of auto-refreshing the content after a manual update to the image has been made. Currently the [TabCarousel Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ddldimidiliclngjipajmjjiakhbcohn) is used to reload the images (see https://uoy.atlassian.net/wiki/x/xUNPAg). This Chrome extension can be used as an alternative, simplified way of reloading the content.
